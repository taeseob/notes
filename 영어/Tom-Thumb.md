# Tom Thumb

There was once a woodsman and his wife who were very sad because they had no children.

"I wouldn't mind," said the wife, "even if we had just one child, but it's very lonely here when you are out all day."

"I know," said the woodsman. "It would be fine to have a youngster about the place."

"I wouldn't mind," said the wife, "if he were no bigger than my thumb. I just wish I could have a child to love and care for."

You can imagine how happy the couple were when sometime later their wish was granted, and they had a small son.

Strangely enough, he was no bigger than a man's thumb, and so they called him "Tom Thumb."
